    "Just like in Lab 02 Exercises, the bulk of this first part is to provide a reference for the functions you'll use. The tables here are taken from the datascience module, so all these table functions can only work if you import datascience (see the first line of code after this).\n",

An index of 0 could refer to the first column or first row (the header row is not given an index) depending on the function. However, if you're typing `existingTable[index]`, it will go for columns, not rows.\n",

    "## Functions used for Tables:\n",
    "Just like in Lab 02 Exercises, the bulk of this first part is to provide a reference for the functions you'll use. The tables here are taken from the datascience module, so all these table functions can only work if you import datascience (see the first line of code after this).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that in a given table, lists make up the rows and arrays make up columns. Additionally, tables have separate indexes for rows and columns. An index of 0 could refer to the first column or first row (the header row is not given an index) depending on the function. However, if you're typing `existingTable[index]`, it will go for columns, not rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm using the same conventions as I did in Exercises 02, namely that all parts that you should change as befit the situation you are in are given capital letters, and those that are to stay the same are all-lowercase. However, the Table datatype naturally has a capital T, and as such, whenever you see a `Table` *by itself*, you shouldn't change that.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm also including the `[etc,etc]` feature, that states that the inputs for these methods can stretch on and on to infinity (assuming that the relevant pattern is still fulfilled). For example, the .with_columns method can add on infinitely many columns so long as the pattern of Header then Array is fulfilled.\n",

# Exercises 02: Version Information
Like all other Exercises, this page will describe all changes made between versions. The Version 1.0 is defined as that which was first released after the end of the Fall 2025 semester.

## Version 0.5 Alpha:
This was the version of the Exercises as first created during STEM-UP Summer 2025. 

## Version 0.8 Beta:
This was the version of the Exercises as used during the Fall 2025 Semester. It greatly modified the exercise problems, with a focus on feasibility within the context of Lab 02 (lists/arrays/strings only).

## Version 0.9 Beta:
This was the version of the Exercises as created (but not used) near the end of the Fall 2025 Semester. It includes a slightly revamped Section Structure and the addition of Exercise problems 2.2 and 2.3.

## Version 1.0 (current):
This is the version that was created in the aftermath of the Fall 2025 Semester. It does away with the information about 'Importing' and 'learning strategy' (effectively reducing its length by half), and adds extra details about Indices.

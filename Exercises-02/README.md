# Exercises 02: Version Information
Like all other Exercises, this page will describe all changes made between versions. The Version 1.0 is defined as that which was first released after the end of the Fall 2025 semester.

## Version 0.5 Alpha:
This was the version of the Exercises as first created during STEM-UP Summer 2025. 

## Version 0.8 Beta:
This was the version of the Exercises as used during the Fall 2025 Semester. 
* Greatly modified the exercise problems, with a focus on feasibility within the context of Lab 02 (lists/arrays/strings only).
* Added the 'Strategy of Coding' section
* Added a few more functions to the toolbox
* Revamped the list/array examples

## Version 0.9 Beta:
This was the version of the Exercises as created (but not used) near the end of the Fall 2025 Semester. 
* Slightly revamped Section Structure
* Addition of Exercise problems 2.2 and 2.3.
* Reworked the Check for Exercise problems 1 to make it actually work (sorry)

## Version 1.0 (current):
This is the version that was created in the aftermath of the Fall 2025 Semester.
* Did away with the information about 'Importing' and 'learning strategy' (effectively reducing its length by half)
* Added extra details about Indices, and Exercise problems 4 involving indices
* Added Problems 1.5 (replacing the check) and 1.6.
* Edited the Trouble Problem (2.3) to mae it easier to follow.
* Removed Exercise 3.1 (on the .eval) because the method was a bit antiquated (no one does it like that really)

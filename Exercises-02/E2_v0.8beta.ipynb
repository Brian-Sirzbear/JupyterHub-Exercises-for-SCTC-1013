    "## Strategy of Coding and the Learning Process\n",
    "At its core, how you approach learning in any subject will affect your proficiency down the line. I personally believe that there is little to no difference between studying a language (e.g. English, French, Russian, etc.) and studying a STEM subject (e.g. Chemistry, Math, Physics), and given that coding (at least in this course) uses aspects of both ends (syntax/grammar vs numbers/data), it seems more than natural that one should adopt a process of learning that is similar to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what do I mean when I talk about the 'process of learning' of studying languages or STEM subjects? Most prominently, I mean that one should think critically above all else. So many people (including past me) believe that studying is all about brute force memorization, but that just strains your mind and doesn't amount to much in the long term. It’s much better to think of all aspects of code as the toolbox that you use for some ulterior purpose. In this sense, the main goal of critical thinking is to chiefly know what each function or method does or can do, and thus what they cannot do (the extent of their ability).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a basic example, you know that a hammer works best for when you want to put a nail in something, and you know that a screwdriver works best for when you want to put a screw in something. Being a beginner at coding is equivalent to not being knowledgeable as to what tools to use for what purpose. (Do I use the hammer for screws? Do I use the screw for nails?) However, as you work with it more and more, you will come to make those connections. Soon, you will be able to tackle more challenging problems, for example: How do you hang a picture on a wall? Well, you need to mark out the position that you want to hang it, you need to drive a nail into that wall (using a hammer), you need to put the picture in a frame, and you need to hang that frame on the wall. This may seem obvious to the point of redundancy, but that’s on purpose; the functions and methods of code are not nearly as obvious in their purposes as real-life examples like hammers and screwdrivers are, but they do function in the same sort of manner and scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Apologies for the giant wall of text; if you are reading this, it probably means that you were curious enough (or desperate enough) to read through all the stuff I had to say here. As thanks, I give you another extra extra credit credit opportunity. Please create another Markdown cell below this, and in that cell please give feedback on how helpful this above advice is. Although I believe fervently in it, I have yet to put it use in a Data Science class. Doing this will net you 1 more extra extra credit credit point.)"

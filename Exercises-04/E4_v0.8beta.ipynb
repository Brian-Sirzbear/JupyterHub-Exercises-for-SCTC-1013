For each character in said plaintext, the coder looks at where that character is in the Plain list, and looks at the Cipher list (having already done any adjustments like shifting movements) to get the encoded character. If it's an A1Z26 cipher, you do not need to create a designated cipher list; the indices themselves, with some small adjustments, do serve as the cipher list in their own right.\n",
